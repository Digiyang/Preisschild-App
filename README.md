# Preisschild-App
A cross platform application.

#Summary:
According to the Federal Office for Statistics, around 350.000 people in Germany have a
visual disablement as their heaviest disablement 1 . This handicap can often lead to
complicating everyday situations. One of these situations is bakery shopping. Visual
handicaps like cataract make the bread collection behind the glass counter seem blurry and
hard to distinguish. Furthermore, finding and reading the price tags can be an overwhelming
task, which leads to an uncomfortable shopping experience.
The Preisschild App aims to tackle this problem by providing visually disabled people with a
digital support tool. Through the App, users can already in advance check the collection of
their go-to bakery. Afterwards, they can add their items of choice on a shopping list. Thus the
shopping process will be user-interactive, accurate and more comfortable.
The interface of the App is especially designed for visually disabled people, using big letters
and symbols. A further feature includes the vocal assistant that can process the order via
voice input. With this feature also blind people are able to use the app.

#How it works:
The App is built using a database, which collects its data from participating bakeries. This
database is connected to the User Interface as well as the voice assistant. Furthermore, text
classification, word representation, user sentiment analysis will be used in the vocal
assistant to become better at processing users requests.

#Objective:
The objective of the project is to establish a service, designed for two types of entities -
visually disabled people and bakeries. The service should be available first on the local level
with a few selected bakeries, later expanding to a national level.

#Roadmap
Finishing and testing the Vocal Assistant with the user group.
Finishing and testing the UI with the user group.
Establishing a network of bakeries.
Collaboration with networks and organisations of blind and visually disabled people.
